"Very frequent polling intervals can cause *busy loops*, resulting in the "

"If a task isn't acknowledged within the ``visibility_timeout``, the task "
"will be redelivered to another worker and executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting-started/brokers/sqs.rst:144
msgid ""
"This causes problems with ETA/countdown/retry tasks where the time to "
"execute exceeds the visibility timeout; in fact if that happens it will "
"be executed again, and again in a loop."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting-started/brokers/sqs.rst:148
msgid ""
"So you have to increase the visibility timeout to match the time of the "
"longest ETA you're planning to use."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting-started/brokers/sqs.rst:151
msgid ""
"Note that Celery will redeliver messages at worker shutdown, so having a "
"long visibility timeout will only delay the redelivery of 'lost' tasks in"
" the event of a power failure or forcefully terminated workers."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting-started/brokers/sqs.rst:156
msgid ""
"Periodic tasks won't be affected by the visibility timeout, as it is a "
